               Sometimes referred to as the “Niagara Falls of India," it is also known
for the medicinal baths. Also known at Marikottayam, Hoge actually means
smoke and Kal means rock. Recently, the place has been found to be littered
with plastic bags and garbage and the fish market outside the waterfall
might stink. Weekends can be crowded. Keep all these points in mind before
visiting.
