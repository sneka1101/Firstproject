                Rameshwaram is located on a beautiful island in the South Indian
             state of Tamil Nadu. It is separated by a small Pamban channel from Sri
             Lanka. According to Hindu mythology, this is the place where Lord Rama
             created a bridge across the sea to Sri Lanka

                    Renowned for its magnificent prakaras with massive sculptured
               pillars on either side, The Ramanathaswamy Temple houses the longest
                corridor in the world. Agniteertham is famous for its sacred waters and
              Pilgrims perform poojas in honour of their ancestors at this seashore. The
              five-faced Hanuman Temple holds the floating stone which was used to build
              the bridge between India and Sri Lanka. Rameshwaram has the first sea
              bridge connecting the town of Mandapam with Pamban Island, and
                 Rameswaram.
